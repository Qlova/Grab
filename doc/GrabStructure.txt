What is the structure of grab?

Grab starts a server and listens on port 222 for incoming clients.

When a client connects, grab spawns a function to deal with the client.

Grab will recieve requests from clients and process them, for example with button requests, a button will be added to the client's scene.

Grab has another process which is drawing scenes.
Whenever a scene is modified, grab will draw it.
This is done through channels, there is no shared memory.
